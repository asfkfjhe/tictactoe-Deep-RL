# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning Environment and Implementations
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning Repository! In this project, I've built a custom Tic-Tac-Toe game environment from scratch and integrated it with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques, including Q-learning. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for experimenting with and implementing deep reinforcement learning algorithms to master the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## What's Inside
## Custom Game Environment
**Tic-Tac-Toe Environment**: I've designed and implemented a flexible, user-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe environment from the ground up. It supports various board sizes and rule configurations, making it an ideal playground for reinforcement learning experiments.
Reinforcement Learning Implementations
**Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: You'll find an implementation of the DQN algorithm tailored to the Tic-Tac-Toe environment. Train agents to learn optimal strategies through Q-learning with deep neural networks.

**Q-learning**: Discover a Q-learning implementation, a classic reinforcement learning algorithm, applied to Tic-Tac-Toe. Observe how agents learn the game's dynamics and strategies through value iteration.

**Policy Gradient Methods**: Explore policy gradient algorithms like REINFORCE, PPO, and A3C, fine-tuned for Tic-Tac-Toe, to learn policy-based strategies.

**Stable Baselines Integration**: I've integrated the Stable Baselines library to provide robust, well-tested implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms. Easily train and evaluate agents using these pre-built algorithms.

**Human vs. AI Mode**: Challenge the AI agents you train with your own Tic-Tac-Toe skills in a user-friendly human-vs-AI mode.
